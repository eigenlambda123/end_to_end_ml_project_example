# End-to-End ML Project Example

This repository demonstrates a **complete machine learning project pipeline**, from data loading and exploration to preprocessing and feature engineering—all structured in a clean and modular way.

It is inspired by the workflow in **Chapter 2** of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by Aurélien Géron. The project uses the California housing dataset and is intended as a reference or starting point for building real-world ML pipelines.

## Project Highlights

* End-to-end ML pipeline using **Scikit-Learn**
* Data loading, visualization, and analysis
* Feature engineering and transformation
* Custom transformers and pipelines
* Categorical handling and scaling
* Modular, production-oriented structure

## Goal

To provide a clear, practical example of how to structure and implement a complete machine learning project—from raw data to a clean processed dataset ready for modeling.

---

## Dataset

The project uses the **California housing dataset**, a common dataset for regression problems.
