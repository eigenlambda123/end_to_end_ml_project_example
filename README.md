# End-to-End ML Regression Project

This repository demonstrates a **complete machine learning pipeline**, covering everything from data acquisition to feature transformation. It is based on **Chapter 2** of *Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow* by AurÃ©lien GÃ©ron.

The project uses the **California housing dataset** and is designed to serve as a robust template for structuring real-world regression workflows.

---

## Project Highlights

- Clean, modular pipeline using **Scikit-Learn**
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with insightful visualizations
- Feature engineering (ratios, log transforms, cluster similarities)
- Custom transformers and reusable pipeline components
- One-hot encoding of categorical features
- Unified `ColumnTransformer`-based preprocessing pipeline
- Output-ready dataset with **24 engineered features**

---

## Goal

To provide a clear, modular, and reproducible example of a real-world machine learning pipeline for regression tasksâ€”structured in a way that supports scaling, experimentation, and future model training.

---

## Dataset

**California Housing Dataset** from the 1990 U.S. Census  
- Predicts median house value from 9+ features
- Common benchmark for regression modeling and pipeline design  
- Loaded via `fetch_california_housing` or from external `.tgz` file
